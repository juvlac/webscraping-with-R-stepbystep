A Tutorial with a Practical Example on Web Scraping with R

You'll find the steps you need to take to extract data from the website of a university's sports program. 
Our goal is to collect data on each course's name, level, time, period, and prices.

In the first part, we'll cover things like HTML basics, the concept of parsing, and XPath expressions, while working on our practical 
example towards automating the searching and extracting process. 
In the second part, you'll see how we can replicate the same process and arrive at the same results using packages from the tidyverse.
